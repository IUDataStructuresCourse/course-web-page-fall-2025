**Indiana University, Fall 2025**

This course studies the fundamental ideas for **correctly** and
**efficiently** analyzing large amounts of data, such as DNA sequence
databases and geographic information. These fundamental ideas come in
two kinds: algorithms and data structures. Algorithms are instructions
for solving problems and data structures are strategies for organizing
information on computers. To implement algorithms and data structures
correctly relies on software engineering skills such as testing,
debugging, and reasoning logically about the code, which we practice
in this course. Efficient algorithms require appropriate data
structures, and vice versa, so the study of algorithms and data
structures is tightly linked. In this course we learn about the
algorithms and data structures that form the building blocks for many
of Today's large-scale computer systems. We apply these ideas to solve
challenging problems in bioinformatics and geographic information
systems. Warning: a possible side-effect of taking this course is
doing better on job interview questions.
